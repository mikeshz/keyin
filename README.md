Keyin aims to make open data more accessible to the public. Currently, websites for Canadian open data online generally provide the information in a manner that is troublesome to interpret or lock features behind paid tiers. The resources being spread across multiple sources also makes it difficult to search for data of interest. 

Keyin makes searching for data an extremely easy and a rewarding experience. It also presents open data in a beautiful and engaging way using visual representations which best fit the datasets being sought for.
